# Silk Road Graph Analyzer

### Introduction:

â€‹	**Silk Road Graph Analyzer** is an application in which you can draw you desired graph with arbitrary IDs and numbers, specify **source** and **destination** node and do the following:

- Find the shortest path available between the source and destination node using **Dijkstra** algorithm
- Solve the TSP (Traveling Sales Person) problem using **Dynamic Programming** algorithm
- Solve the TSP (Traveling Sales Person) problem using **Ant Colony** algorithm.



### Libraries Used:

- [FontAwesomeFX](https://bitbucket.org/Jerady/fontawesomefx)

### Manual:

#### Modes:

The application has 4 different modes:

1. **Node Mode:** Add new edges to the graph with automatically generated numeric ID.

2. **Directional Edge Mode:** Draw directional edge between two desired nodes with user-input edge weight.

3. **Non-directional Edge Mode:** Draw non-directional edge between two desired nodes with user-input edge weight. Non-directional edge acts as if two directional edges have been drawn between the two nodes in opposite directions.

   - **<u>Note:</u>** This mode is disabled if the selected problem is Traveling Sales Person

4. **Select Mode:** Select graph elements and move the nodes in the canvas. You must left-click the element for selection or drag the mouse to move it.

   * **<u>Note:</u>** You are only able to move graph **nodes**.

#### Selection:

You can select **single** or **multiple** elements in the canvas. If you **hold the shift key**, you can add other elements to the selection with **mouse click** retaining the previous selections.

You can delete the selected items using the **Delete** button in the left menu or pressing the **Delete** key on the keyboard.

#### Deletion:

You can delete selected items like we said above, or delete everything by clicking on **Delete** button or pressing **delete key** on the keyboard when **<u>nothing is selected</u>**.

#### Node Tools:

- **Edit node ID:** You can select a node and press **Change ID** button in the tools menu on the left side, then enter the desired ID when prompted.

- **Set source node:** You can set a node as **source** by selecting it and pressing **Set as Source** button in the tools menu on the left side. This will unset the previously selected source button if there is any.

- **Set destination node:** You can set a node as **destination** by selecting it and pressing **Set as Target** button in the tools menu on the left side. This will **unset the previously selected** destination node if there is any.

#### Edge tools:

- **Edit edge weight:** You can change the weight for a **single** or **multiple** selected edges by pressing the **Change Edge Weight** button in the tools menu on the left side, then entering the desired value when prompted.

- **Change edge direction:** You can change the direction of a single selected edge by pressing the **Change Edge Direction** button in the tools menu on the left side. This only applies to **directional edges**, when **no edge** exists between the two nodes in the **opposite direction**.
